.. _mailgun-backend:

Mailgun
=======

Anymail integrates with the `Mailgun <https://mailgun.com>`_
transactional email service from Rackspace, using their
REST API.


Settings
--------

.. rubric:: EMAIL_BACKEND

To use Anymail's Mailgun backend, set:

  .. code-block:: python

      EMAIL_BACKEND = "anymail.backends.mailgun.EmailBackend"

in your settings.py.


.. setting:: ANYMAIL_MAILGUN_API_KEY

.. rubric:: MAILGUN_API_KEY

Required for sending. Your Mailgun "Private API key" from the Mailgun
`API security settings`_:

  .. code-block:: python

      ANYMAIL = {
          ...
          "MAILGUN_API_KEY": "<your API key>",
      }

Anymail will also look for ``MAILGUN_API_KEY`` at the
root of the settings file if neither ``ANYMAIL["MAILGUN_API_KEY"]``
nor ``ANYMAIL_MAILGUN_API_KEY`` is set.


.. setting:: ANYMAIL_MAILGUN_SENDER_DOMAIN

.. rubric:: MAILGUN_SENDER_DOMAIN

If you are using a specific `Mailgun sender domain`_
that is *different* from your messages' `from_email` domains,
set this to the domain you've configured in your Mailgun account.

If your messages' `from_email` domains always match a configured
Mailgun sender domain, this setting is not needed.

See :ref:`mailgun-sender-domain` below for examples.


.. setting:: ANYMAIL_MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY

.. rubric:: MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY

.. versionadded:: 6.1

Required for tracking or inbound webhooks. Your "HTTP webhook signing key" from the
Mailgun `API security settings`_:

  .. code-block:: python

      ANYMAIL = {
          ...
          "MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY": "<your webhook signing key>",
      }

If not provided, Anymail will attempt to validate webhooks using the
:setting:`MAILGUN_API_KEY <ANYMAIL_MAILGUN_API_KEY>` setting instead. (These two keys have
the same values for new Mailgun users, but will diverge if you ever rotate either key.)


.. setting:: ANYMAIL_MAILGUN_API_URL

.. rubric:: MAILGUN_API_URL

The base url for calling the Mailgun API. It does not include
the sender domain. (Anymail :ref:`figures this out <mailgun-sender-domain>`
for you.)

The default is ``MAILGUN_API_URL = "https://api.mailgun.net/v3"``, which connects
to Mailgun's US service. You must override this if you are using Mailgun's European
region:

  .. code-block:: python

      ANYMAIL = {
        "MAILGUN_API_KEY": "...",
        "MAILGUN_API_URL": "https://api.eu.mailgun.net/v3",
        # ...
      }


.. _API security settings: https://app.mailgun.com/app/account/security/api_keys


.. _mailgun-sender-domain:

Email sender domain
-------------------

Mailgun's API requires identifying the sender domain.
By default, Anymail uses the domain of each messages's `from_email`
(e.g., "example.com" for "from\@example.com").

You will need to override this default if you are using
a dedicated `Mailgun sender domain`_ that is different from
a message's `from_email` domain.

For example, if you are sending from "orders\@example.com", but your
Mailgun account is configured for "*mail1*.example.com", you should provide
:setting:`MAILGUN_SENDER_DOMAIN <ANYMAIL_MAILGUN_SENDER_DOMAIN>` in your settings.py:

    .. code-block:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 4

        ANYMAIL = {
            ...
            "MAILGUN_API_KEY": "<your API key>",
            "MAILGUN_SENDER_DOMAIN": "mail1.example.com"
        }


If you need to override the sender domain for an individual message,
use Anymail's :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.envelope_sender`
(only the domain is used; anything before the @ is ignored):

    .. code-block:: python

        message = EmailMessage(from_email="marketing@example.com", ...)
        message.envelope_sender = "anything@mail2.example.com"  # the "anything@" is ignored


.. versionchanged:: 2.0

    Earlier Anymail versions looked for a special `sender_domain` key in the message's
    :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.esp_extra` to override Mailgun's sender domain.
    This is still supported, but may be deprecated in a future release. Using
    :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.envelope_sender` as shown above is now preferred.

.. _Mailgun sender domain:
    https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/202256730-How-do-I-pick-a-domain-name-for-my-Mailgun-account-


.. _mailgun-esp-extra:

exp_extra support
-----------------

Anymail's Mailgun backend will pass all :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.esp_extra`
values directly to Mailgun. You can use any of the (non-file) parameters listed in the
`Mailgun sending docs`_. Example:

  .. code-block:: python

      message = AnymailMessage(...)
      message.esp_extra = {
          'o:testmode': 'yes',  # use Mailgun's test mode
      }

.. _mailgun-quirks:

Limitations and quirks
----------------------

**Attachments require filenames**
  Mailgun has an `undocumented API requirement`_ that every attachment must have a
  filename. Attachments with missing filenames are silently dropped from the sent
  message. Similarly, every inline attachment must have a :mailheader:`Content-ID`.

  To avoid unexpected behavior, Anymail will raise an
  :exc:`~anymail.exceptions.AnymailUnsupportedFeature` error if you attempt to send
  a message through Mailgun with any attachments that don't have filenames (or inline
  attachments that don't have :mailheader:`Content-ID`\s).

  Ensure your attachments have filenames by using
  :class:`message.attach_file(filename) <django.core.mail.EmailMessage>`,
  :class:`message.attach(content, filename="...") <django.core.mail.EmailMessage>`,
  or if you are constructing your own MIME objects to attach,
  :meth:`mimeobj.add_header("Content-Disposition", "attachment", filename="...") <email.message.Message.add_header>`.

  Ensure your inline attachments have Content-IDs by using Anymail's
  :ref:`inline image helpers <inline-images>`, or if you are constructing your own MIME objects,
  :meth:`mimeobj.add_header("Content-ID", "...") <email.message.Message.add_header>` and
  :meth:`mimeobj.add_header("Content-Disposition", "inline") <email.message.Message.add_header>`.

  .. versionchanged:: 4.3

      Earlier Anymail releases did not check for these cases, and attachments
      without filenames/Content-IDs would be ignored by Mailgun without notice.

**Envelope sender uses only domain**
  Anymail's :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.envelope_sender` is used to
  select your Mailgun :ref:`sender domain <mailgun-sender-domain>`. For
  obvious reasons, only the domain portion applies. You can use anything before
  the @, and it will be ignored.

**Using merge_metadata with merge_data**
  If you use both Anymail's :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_data`
  and :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_metadata` features, make sure your
  merge_data keys do not start with ``v:``. (It's a good idea anyway to avoid colons
  and other special characters in merge_data keys, as this isn't generally portable
  to other ESPs.)

  The same underlying Mailgun feature ("recipient-variables") is used to implement
  both Anymail features. To avoid conflicts, Anymail prepends ``v:`` to recipient
  variables needed for merge_metadata. (This prefix is stripped as Mailgun prepares
  the message to send, so it won't be present in your Mailgun API logs or the metadata
  that is sent to tracking webhooks.)

**merge_metadata values default to empty string**
  If you use Anymail's :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_metadata` feature,
  and you supply metadata keys for some recipients but not others, Anymail will first
  try to resolve the missing keys in :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.metadata`,
  and if they are not found there will default them to an empty string value.

  Your tracking webhooks will receive metadata values (either that you provided or the
  default empty string) for *every* key used with *any* recipient in the send.

.. _mailgun-templates:

Batch sending/merge and ESP templates
-------------------------------------

Mailgun does not offer :ref:`ESP stored templates <esp-stored-templates>`,
so Anymail's :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.template_id` message
attribute is not supported with the Mailgun backend.

Mailgun *does* support :ref:`batch sending <batch-send>` with per-recipient
merge data. You can refer to Mailgun "recipient variables" in your
message subject and body, and supply the values with Anymail's
normalized :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_data`
and :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.merge_global_data`
message attributes:

  .. code-block:: python

      message = EmailMessage(
          ...
          subject="Your order %recipient.order_no% has shipped",
          body="""Hi %recipient.name%,
                  We shipped your order %recipient.order_no%
                  on %recipient.ship_date%.""",
          to=["alice@example.com", "Bob <bob@example.com>"]
      )
      # (you'd probably also set a similar html body with %recipient.___% variables)
      message.merge_data = {
          'alice@example.com': {'name': "Alice", 'order_no': "12345"},
          'bob@example.com': {'name': "Bob", 'order_no': "54321"},
      }
      message.merge_global_data = {
          'ship_date': "May 15"  # Anymail maps globals to all recipients
      }

Mailgun does not natively support global merge data. Anymail emulates
the capability by copying any `merge_global_data` values to each
recipient's section in Mailgun's "recipient-variables" API parameter.

See the `Mailgun batch sending`_ docs for more information.

.. _mailgun-webhooks:

Status tracking webhooks
------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

    Added support for Mailgun's June, 2018 (non-"legacy") webhook format.

.. versionchanged:: 6.1

    Added support for a new :setting:`MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY <ANYMAIL_MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY>`
    setting, separate from your MAILGUN_API_KEY.

If you are using Anymail's normalized :ref:`status tracking <event-tracking>`, enter
the url in the Mailgun webhooks config for your domain. (Be sure to select the correct
sending domain---Mailgun's sandbox and production domains have separate webhook settings.)

Mailgun allows you to enter a different URL for each event type: just enter this same
Anymail tracking URL for all events you want to receive:

   :samp:`https://{random}:{random}@{yoursite.example.com}/anymail/mailgun/tracking/`

     * *random:random* is an :setting:`ANYMAIL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` shared secret
     * *yoursite.example.com* is your Django site

Mailgun implements a limited form of webhook signing, and Anymail will verify
these signatures against your
:setting:`MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY <ANYMAIL_MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY>`
Anymail setting. By default, Mailgun's webhook signature provides similar security
to Anymail's shared webhook secret, so it's acceptable to omit the
:setting:`ANYMAIL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` setting (and "{random}:{random}@" portion of the
webhook url) with Mailgun webhooks.

Mailgun will report these Anymail :attr:`~anymail.signals.AnymailTrackingEvent.event_type`\s:
delivered, rejected, bounced, complained, unsubscribed, opened, clicked.

The event's :attr:`~anymail.signals.AnymailTrackingEvent.esp_event` field will be
the parsed `Mailgun webhook payload`_ as a Python `dict` with ``"signature"`` and
``"event-data"`` keys.

Anymail uses Mailgun's webhook `token` as its normalized
:attr:`~anymail.signals.AnymailTrackingEvent.event_id`, rather than Mailgun's
event-data `id` (which is only guaranteed to be unique during a single day).
If you need the event-data id, it can be accessed in your webhook handler as
``event.esp_event["event-data"]["id"]``. (This can be helpful for working with
Mailgun's other event APIs.)

.. note:: **Mailgun legacy webhooks**

    In late June, 2018, Mailgun introduced a new set of webhooks with an improved
    payload design, and at the same time renamed their original webhooks to "Legacy
    Webhooks."

    Anymail v4.0 and later supports both new and legacy Mailgun webhooks, and the same
    Anymail webhook url works as either. Earlier Anymail versions can only be used
    as legacy webhook urls.

    The new (non-legacy) webhooks are preferred, particularly with Anymail's
    :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.metadata` and
    :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.tags` features. But if you have already
    configured the legacy webhooks, there is no need to change.

    If you are using Mailgun's legacy webhooks:

    * The :attr:`event.esp_event <anymail.signals.AnymailTrackingEvent.esp_event>` field
      will be a Django :class:`~django.http.QueryDict` of Mailgun event fields (the
      raw POST data provided by legacy webhooks).

    * You should avoid using "body-plain," "h," "message-headers," "message-id" or "tag"
      as :attr:`~anymail.message.AnymailMessage.metadata` keys. A design limitation in
      Mailgun's legacy webhooks prevents Anymail from reliably retrieving this metadata
      from opened, clicked, and unsubscribed events. (This is not an issue with the
      newer, non-legacy webhooks.)

.. _mailgun-inbound:

Inbound webhook
---------------

If you want to receive email from Mailgun through Anymail's normalized :ref:`inbound <inbound>`
handling, follow Mailgun's `Receiving, Storing and Fowarding Messages`_ guide to set up
an inbound route that forwards to Anymail's inbound webhook. (You can configure routes
using Mailgun's API, or simply using the `Mailgun receiving config`_.)

The *action* for your route will be either:

   :samp:`forward("https://{random}:{random}@{yoursite.example.com}/anymail/mailgun/inbound/")`
   :samp:`forward("https://{random}:{random}@{yoursite.example.com}/anymail/mailgun/inbound_mime/")`

     * *random:random* is an :setting:`ANYMAIL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` shared secret
     * *yoursite.example.com* is your Django site

Anymail accepts either of Mailgun's "fully-parsed" (.../inbound/) and "raw MIME" (.../inbound_mime/)
formats; the URL tells Mailgun which you want. Because Anymail handles parsing and normalizing the data,
both are equally easy to use. The raw MIME option will give the most accurate representation of *any*
received email (including complex forms like multi-message mailing list digests). The fully-parsed option
*may* use less memory while processing messages with many large attachments.

If you want to use Anymail's normalized :attr:`~anymail.inbound.AnymailInboundMessage.spam_detected` and
:attr:`~anymail.inbound.AnymailInboundMessage.spam_score` attributes, you'll need to set your Mailgun
domain's inbound spam filter to "Deliver spam, but add X-Mailgun-SFlag and X-Mailgun-SScore headers"
(in the `Mailgun domains config`_).

Anymail will verify Mailgun inbound message events using your
:setting:`MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY <ANYMAIL_MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY>`
Anymail setting. By default, Mailgun's webhook signature provides similar security
to Anymail's shared webhook secret, so it's acceptable to omit the
:setting:`ANYMAIL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` setting (and "{random}:{random}@" portion of the
action) with Mailgun inbound routing.
